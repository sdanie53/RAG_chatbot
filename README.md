# RAG-Based Chatbot with Pinecone
## Overview
This chatbot leverages the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, integrating it with a powerful vector database, Pinecone, to provide accurate, context-aware responses. It uses PDF and text files as the basis for its knowledge, making it ideal for specialized fields or extensive document-based information repositories. I have used Chainlit to create a simple chat interface. 

## Features
- RAG Model: Utilizes the latest in NLP to generate responses that are contextually relevant and accurate.
- Pinecone Integration: Takes advantage of Pinecone's vector search capabilities for efficient document retrieval.
- PDF and Text File Support: Can process and understand information from both PDF and text documents, expanding its knowledge base.
